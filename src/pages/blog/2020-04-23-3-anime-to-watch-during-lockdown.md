Some of you may know that I used to be the president of the anime society at UNSW. Here are a few shows that I love to tide you through quarantine.

### Silver Spoon

`Length: 11 Episodes [S1] + 11 Episodes [S2]`

First, my favourite anime! A genuinely interesting look at the agricultural industry served against the backdrop of polished animation, [awesome music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONNFHTOueXo) and funny moments. By far its biggest strength is its lovable set of characters (people and animals!) Cute and funny but surprisingly emotional at times, watch this if you're looking to brighten your day. This show never fails to put a smile on my face.

### Baccano!

`Length: 13 Episodes`

It wouldn't be a stretch to call Baccano a masterpiece. A unique premise blending a 1930s mafia war with alchemy and immortals. This show ambitiously sets out with three separate storylines and masterfully weaves them together by the end. You'll be gripped within the first episode! 

(Watch the [opening](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOZ1hsb8smQ) to get a sense of the show's style.)

### Welcome to the N.H.K.

`Length: 24 Episodes`

Lots of fun with a pinch of depression. "Welcome to the NHK" follows a NEETs struggle against the downward spiral of his life. While hilarious, this show also touches on deeper issues that we all deal with from time to time: social anxiety, running away from reality, self pity and putting up walls. This series captures the not so glamorous journey of picking yourself up again after you've ended up in a bad place. I'm sure that if you give this series a try, you'll find a relatable moment.
