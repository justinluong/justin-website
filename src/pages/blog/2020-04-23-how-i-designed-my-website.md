I've never thought of myself as artistic, if you told me to draw something I wouldn't know where to start. But, I've found two strategies to express my creativity that work for my analytical personality. They are **designing through curation** and **working from first principles**.

## Designing through curation

It's easier to answer "Do you want to eat this?" instead of "What do you want to eat?". The first question really only has two answers: yes or no. The second forces you to think through a much larger search space. You can apply the same idea when designing something. Instead of trying to draw an ideal design from scratch, observe your reactions when looking at what others have done.

### What I did

I started my design process by gathering a list of personal websites and blogs. Then I went through each one and noted if I liked it or not. After that, I came back to the websites that I liked and looked for what was common between them.

It turns out that I like:

* Simple designs with a creative flare.
* Strong colours and high contrast.
* Bold design choices.

### Steal like an artist

Don't worry about being an imitator. Your unique style comes from mixing the things that you like together. Copy the elements of each website that resonate with you.

A silent thank you to the websites that I drew inspiration from:

* [Jessdesigntan](http://jessdesigntan.com/)
* [Mark Manson](https://markmanson.net/)
* [Medium](https://medium.com/)

## Working from first principles

Learning something new, I make the biggest improvements once I understand the fundamental building blocks of the topic. If I can put into words why I think something is good or bad, I can try to improve on it. 

What I've learned so far is that the visual design of a page implicitly communicates information to the viewer. It can help organise your message if done well or obscure it if done poorly. Here are some tips that have helped me:

### Proximity

The proximity of elements on a page convey their relationship. If things are close together, the viewer assumes they're related. If things are evenly spaced apart, the viewer assumes they're a subset of a larger whole.

### Alignment

Good alignment organises and structures information on your page which makes it easier for the viewer to process. A strong and consistent left alignment is a great baseline to work from. Centred alignments don't add as much structure to a page so use them sparingly.

### Visual Hierarchy

Visual hierarchy helps a viewer understand a page by presenting an order to follow. Forcing someone to process everything at once can be overwhelming. Colour and contrast are ways to introduce visual hierarchy to a design.

Thanks for reading! I hope this helps if you decide to design your own website.
