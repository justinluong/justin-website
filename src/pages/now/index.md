title: What I'm Doing Now
---
### Work

I started a job this year as a Machine Learning Engineer! Really enjoying delving back into writing software. My main focus right now is to build my technical skills in this field.

In my spare time I'm still doing my podcast but it's more on maintenance mode at the moment, not really actively focusing on it.

### Leisure

Still doing a lot of BJJ, I've been thinking about getting back into singing lessons but I'll need to carve out time for it.
