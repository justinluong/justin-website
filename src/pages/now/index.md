title: What I'm Doing Now
---
### Work

I've been teaching over video calls recently and it's been working really well. While I learnt a lot about making videos through recording lectures, students didn't seem to get as much out of it. Instead, I've applied those same skills to making [short youtube videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hiic6mMAfA) on maths. 

### Leisure

After signing up for Anime Lab I've been watching a lot more anime recently. The nice interface genuinely gives me that tiny bit of incentive to watch it over other things. Otherwise, I'm playing a lot of Teamfight Tactics (Diamond 3 right now).

### Recent Stuff

* I talked about managing procrastination in my latest [podcast episode](https://youtu.be/u-gzXVInMIU).
* I [vlogged](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N70Apom98cQ) my trip to Thailand where I trained Bjj for two weeks.
