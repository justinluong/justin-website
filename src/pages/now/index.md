title: What I'm Doing Now
---
Paradoxically, there's more variety in my life despite the lockdown limiting my activity choice. Rather than default to what I normally do, I've been forced to actively think about how I want to spend my time.

### Work

Transitioning my [maths tutoring business](http://facebook.com/kaizenacademyAU) online has been a challenge but I'm settling into a nice rhythm. Most of my time goes into creating worksheets and recording lectures for my students. I'm also experimenting with posting short form maths videos on Youtube.

### Leisure

If you keep your eyes peeled, there's a good chance you'll see me taking solitary strolls around Cabramatta. Lately, I've been having a lot of fun learning about graphic design. Apart from that, I split my free time between: reading, programming my website, singing, playing TFT and watching Korean dramas.

### Recent Stuff
