title: What I'm Doing Now
---
### Work

A friend of mine helped me film a video advertisement for my business. My current focus is on helping my current students get through their HSC year while also finding students for next year.

### Leisure

I've recently decided that I want to quit games for a year! I found that I was spending too much time with it and was more frustrated than having fun most of the time. It always surprises me how much more leisure time I feel like I have when I don't play games.

At the moment I'm reading 'The Way of Kings' by Brandon Sanderson. Finally getting to it after I promised two friends I would read it over a year ago... 

### Recent Stuff

* Went on a short post uni retreat with two friends to think about my goals.
* Finished my last subject at uni!
